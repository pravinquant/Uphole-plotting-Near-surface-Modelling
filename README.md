# Uphole Plotting & Near Surface Modelling Tool
This software is for Land Seismic Data Acquistion crew. It will help to Plot Upholes both (PP and PP-PS components), prepare 3D models and estimate field static corrections.

## Features

- Import uphole data in .seg2 or segy format.
- Automatically picks first breaks of direct wave events.
- Automatically fits the layers or piece-wise fitting of uphole (Time/Depth)TD curve.
- Applies spherical divergence correction and displays the amplitude/Q factor of direct arrivals which helps in better discrimation of Lithology.
- Prepares 3D Velcoity Model for shot hole depth optimization and estimate static corrections.
- Export outputs as power-point presenations and .csv format.
